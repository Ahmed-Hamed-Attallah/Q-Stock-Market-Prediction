# Stock Prediction Project README

## Overview
This project, developed during an AI internship at UneeQ, predicts stock prices using historical data and **LSTM neural networks**. It provides insights for investment decisions and financial analysis.

---

## Key Components

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Dataset: Historical stock data (2010–2020) including Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Trading Volume.
- Preprocessing: Date standardization, missing value handling, normalization, and feature engineering.

### 2. **Methodology**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras, statsmodels.
- **Model**: LSTM with EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks.
- **Analysis**: Time series decomposition, stationarity testing (ADF test), and autocorrelation analysis.

### 3. **Visualization**
- Interactive price trends, volume-price relationships, and technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

### 4. **Preliminary Results**
- Clear upward trends with market volatility.
- Stationarity confirmed in differenced close prices (ADF Statistic: -8.2676, p-value: 0.0000).

## Future Work
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, R².
- Compare LSTM with ARIMA/SARIMA.
- Add sentiment analysis (news/social media) and portfolio optimization.
- Build an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.

---

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Data Quality**: Handled missing values with forward filling.
- **Model Complexity**: Used regularization and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Computational Load**: Optimized batching and hardware acceleration for LSTM training.

---

## Business Applications
- **Investment Support**: Short-term trading signals and long-term investment timing.
- **Financial Analysis**: Market trend identification and volatility forecasting.

---

## Conclusion
This project establishes a robust framework for stock price prediction using LSTMs. It lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including advanced analytics and real-time deployment.
